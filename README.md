- [ ] need to verify that we can run validation
  - [ ] Why is validation loss so low compared to the training loss, at the beginning of training?
- [ ] Batch Size - Stress test VRAM to proper batch size for the dataloader_config.json
- [ ] Figure out final training configs for the model.
- [ ] Run a quick test ( with val / checkpointing ) at shorter timestep -> then reset to proper vals.
